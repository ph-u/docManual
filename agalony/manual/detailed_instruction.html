        <h1 id="data">Data folder</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos to be analysed should be in the same folder, if they are intended to be counted in one run</li>
            <li>All images should be included in the <b>range.csv</b> file as an unique row</li>
            <li>The data folder can be at anywhere in the computer</li>
            <li>The minimal data folder for a successful run contains one image and a single-lined <b>range.csv</b> with 15 columns outlining the pixel attributes of that photo</li>

                <li>tif (TIF, tiff, TIFF)</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Typical photos from <b>phone cameras</b> and <b>webcam screenshots</b> are in jpg and png formats respectively, so users just need to transfer the raw photos to a computer</li>
            <li>Blurry images are accepted, the only problem is the accuracy (and hence confidence to users' result): it is hard to define XY boundaries for the 2D plane and sample colonies</li>
            <li>It is recommended users to have a simple tripod (using a small but fixed set-up) to hold up the camera -- this can minimise the chance of</li>

        <h1 id="logic">Understanding the <b>range.csv</b> from the program's point of view</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>This row of data is taken as the supervising data when analysing the photo "microscope_400x_Ecoli.jpg" (or other acceptable extensions listed above)</li>
            <li>The 14th column "Horizontal/Protrait" (i.e. "H") is taken to identify "microscope_400x_Ecoli.jpg" is a horizontal photo -- this is to root the XY coordinates of the raw plain text data [microscope_400x_Ecoli.csv]</li>
            <li>Column 2-5 (the rim XYs) indicate only pixels included in this "oval" is considered</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The program is not able to calculate an oval but approximately cut out a flat-boundary oval</li>
                <li>Circle radii along X-axis ( |20-1877| = 1857) &#8826 Y-axis ( |2179-60| = 2119 )</li>
                <li>Hence only the pixels within the larger circle & X-coordinate within the X-axis boundaries are recorded [microscope_400x_Ecoli_agar.csv]</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Same criteria are used for identifying the area of sample 1 & 2 but this time the RGB (ranged 0-255) is compared to get the minimum and maximum ranges [microscope_400x_Ecoli_rgb.csv]</li>
            <li>Using the "microscope_400x_Ecoli_rgb.csv", the program further filter data from "microscope_400x_Ecoli_agar.csv" and record only the pixels with all three RGB values within the respective ranges [microscope_400x_Ecoli_fil.csv]</li>
            <li>Using the last column (px : unit ratio), the program approximates the number of regular sized unit</li>
            <div><ol>
                <li>Count the number of pixels remaining (i.e. number of data rows in "microscope_400x_Ecoli_fil.csv" excluding the header row -- "number of rows -1")</li>
                <li>The number obtained is devided by the ratio (i.e. 12) in "range.csv"</li>
                <li>This approximation is reported as a data row in the final spreadsheet [00Colony.csv]</li>
            </ol></div>

            <ul>
                <li>Users are strongly suggested to only put photos and one range.csv in a subfolder inside their data directory; the final output "00Colony.csv" should be sorted as the top file if files are arranged in accending order by names</li>
                <li>This step can approximately save the user 200MB disk space per photo depending on the image's original size</li>
                <li>The "clear" option is best being implemented when the user is confident on the XY coordinates only capture pixels of desirable RGB ranges</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <warn>
            <p>Users should be <b>WARNED</b> that although the "clear" option is intended to delete only the intermediate files (the program only identifies csv files starting with the photo names) generated during the filtering process, there is a risk if users put other csv files into the photo folder with names similar to the naming format this program identifies</p>

            <p>It is the users' responsibility if unnecessary files are in the photo directory and get permanently removed</p>

            <p>This pipeline never process data outside the user-indicated photo directory</p>

        <h1 id="rgb">RGB data intermediate storage -- *_rgb.csv</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>This is an intermediate file generated at the same step as "*_agar.csv" recording the RGB limits for the next colour-filtering step</li>
            <li>The file has only one line with six numbers separated by commas</li>
            <li>General format: min_R, max_R, min_G, max_G, min_B, max_B</li>

        <h1 id="run">Running the program</h1>
        <p>"agalony.sh" is the commandline interface (CLI) accepting user's interactions</p>

        <p>Although users can run individual steps on their own folowing the input instructions in respective scripts, it is advised not to do it unless users are familar with commandline programs</p>

        <p>It is common to run this program multiple times in order to refine the XY coordinate boundaries for the two RGB samples (columns 6-13) and pixel : unit ratio (column 15)</p>
